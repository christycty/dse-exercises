<p>You are learning bitwise operation. Write a program to help you calculate various types of bitwise operations.</p>

<p>You can learn about bitwise operations from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">this Wikipedia page.</a></p>

<h1>Input and Output</h1>

<p>The only line of input contains two integers $A$ and $B$, separated by a space. ($0 \le A, B \le 100,000$)</p>

<p>On the first line output the bitwise OR of $A$ and $B$.
<br>On the second line output the bitwise AND of $A$ and $B$.
<br>On the third line output the bitwise XOR of $A$ and $B$.</p>
<br>On the fourth line output the bitwise complement of $A$.</p>
