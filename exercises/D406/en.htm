<p>You will be given a list of integers sorted in ascending order. Write a program to remove its duplicates. For example, given a list $[3, 3, 6, 7, 7, 7]$, the program should output $[3, 6, 7]$</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains one integer $N$, the number of integers in the list. ($1 \le N \le 20$)</p>
<p>The second line contains the list of $N$ integers. The integers are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$ (the range of 32-bit integer).</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Output the dediplicated list on one line, seperate the values by spaces. The values should be in same order as input</p>
