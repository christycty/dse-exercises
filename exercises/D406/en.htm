<p>You will be given a list of integers. Write a program to find the number of unique values in the list, and a list of the first occurence of each value with their relative order preserved. For example, the list $[6, 3, 3, 7, 6, 7, 9]$ has 4 unique values, and the list $[6, 3, 7, 9]$ contains the first occurence of each value.</p>

<h1>Input</h1>

<p>The first line contains one integer $N$, the number of integers in the list. ($1 \le N \le 20$)</p>
<p>The second line contains the list of $N$ integers. The integers are in $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$ (the range of 32-bit integer).</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>In the first line, output the number of unique values in the inputted list.
<p>In the second line, output the de-duplicated list with the values seperated by spaces.</p>
